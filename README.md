My nickname is krystlepalace and i am backend web developer. I have started learning programming a year ago and still practicing to code better and more complicated apps. 
I make telegram bots with aiogram, APIs with FastAPI and websites with Django.
I am also studying javascript for fullstack developing and learning things about programming overall.
Always happy to work together and ready to take orders.
